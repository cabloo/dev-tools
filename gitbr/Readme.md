Setup
=====
- Put `gitbr` in `/usr/local/bin`.
- If necessary, replace `master` and `origin` with the main branch and remote of the repository.
- Make it executable (`chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gitbr`).

Usage
=====
- Run `gitbr` with no arguments to have the branch name generated for you (e.g. `04-13-001274741-2015`).
- Run `gitbr <branch_name_here>` to use a specific branch name.
